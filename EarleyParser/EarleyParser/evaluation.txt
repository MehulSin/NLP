Evaluate the parser in its current form:
What sorts of sentences can it parse?
What types of sentences will it fail to parse?
What improvements to the grammar or parser are required to properly parse common failed sentences?


1.1 . Sentences that are parsed:
      -john lives in chicago
      -these aliens do drive
      -john steals jetcar

1.2.Sentences that fail to be parsed
      -jetcar is on planet earth
      -she did it
      -the watermelon is from chicago
      -Is this jetcar
      -This is planet earth

1.3.The grammer can be improved by adding more rules to parse above failed sentences ie., after adding the rule vbar->faux all the three sentences are parsing succesfully.
    We have also added new terminals and sentences formed from those terminals are also getting parsed.
    For fourth sentence we added 2 grammer,then it started working.
    For fifth sentence we addes 1 grammer,then it started working.
    If the sentence can be parsed in multiple ways ,the best parsed tree is taken into consideration along with its probability.
